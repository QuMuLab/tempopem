Check if we can execute step2 right away.:G/0.0/f2
Execute step1.:A/0.0/step1
Check again for step2:G/0.0/f2
Check for step2 after t=3:G/3.0/f2
Check for step2 after t=5:G/5.0/f2
Check for step2 after t=5.1:G/5.1/f2

Check what the first action should be:G/0.0/f1
Execute step1 at time 3:A/3.0/step1
Check what the agent should do at t=3:G/3.0/f2
Check again 3 time steps later:G/6.0/f2
And one more time in another 1 time step:G/7.0/f2
Execute step2:A/7.0/step2
Check what the agent should now do:G/7.0/f3
